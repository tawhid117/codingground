I keep my hobby and tutorial projects here:

<br>

<a href="https://github.com/tawhid117/codingground/tree/master/crawling_ecom">Crawling sites of MeenaClick and Shawpno to find vegetable prices compare them side by side.</a>

<br>

<a href="https://github.com/tawhid117/codingground/tree/master/simpleCalculator">To demonstrate the TkInter GUI package, a simple calculator is built.</a>
